## Skills


#### Paper Reading

I'm full of interest in doing survey on the latest progress of my research area. It's just like having a big meal while reading a good paper. Attended the 4th CCF Big Data conference in 2016.

#### English

Although not a native speaker, but I love English. I can talk freely with foreigners.

- TOEFL score of 99.
- Cet-6 score of 559.

#### Coding

I've passed all of the exams in my college and got high scores on most of them.
I'd like to bulid apps and systems on my own, and try to make them look nice and easy to use.
